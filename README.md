| [SQL QuickStart Guide](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B081P1YYFB/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=1T9iR&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=J2KY0XENGFQCDRSNTC8K&pd_rd_r=1aaafd3d-e98f-4713-8517-fa692f501a56&pd_rd_wg=128ET&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) | I absolutely loved this book. Working on toy datasets at university will only take you so far. Dealing with real-world data comes with a lot more complexity and only a deeper understanding of it can lead to true business value. Thus, you must learn a database programming language. None of it is unfortunately taught in lectures, but this book helps to fill the void for a structured introduction to the declarative language named SQL, short for Structured Query Language. I have browser through many high-rated tutorials but their content is not sufficient. This book gives you a necessary overview of all the tools and techniques you will require in your early years. It contains a software and sample data to familiarize yourself with how a database is set up and how it is to be used. Moreover, many examples and exercises will keep you attentive and help you absorb new concepts. |
