# Becoming A Software Professional // Work in Progress
Congratulations! If you've made it this far you can pat yourself on the back. Mastering the fundamentals in a career like software engineering is no small feat. Great work indeed! But as you might have guessed learning doesn't end here. 


## Resources :point_down:
Please go through these resources in the listed order. Bookmark them if you must. It is time to do the actual work starting today!
| Book / Course / Platform | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [SQL QuickStart Guide](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B081P1YYFB/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=1T9iR&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=J2KY0XENGFQCDRSNTC8K&pd_rd_r=1aaafd3d-e98f-4713-8517-fa692f501a56&pd_rd_wg=128ET&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) | I absolutely loved this book! Working on toy datasets at university will only take you so far. Dealing with real-world data comes with a lot more complexity and only a deeper understanding of it can lead to true business value. Thus, you must learn a database programming language. None of it is unfortunately taught in lectures, but this book helps to fill the void for a structured introduction to the declarative language named SQL, short for Structured Query Language. I have come across many high-rated tutorials but their content is not sufficient. This book gives you a necessary overview of all the tools and techniques you will require in your very first year as a software engineer. It contains a database software and sample data to familiarize yourself with how a database is set up and how it is to be used. Moreover, many examples and exercises will keep you attentive and help you absorb new concepts quickly. |
| [Learning Source Control with Git and SourceTree](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B074HFY8HW/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=MrDUV&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=N1PR5B7RAGFT3TDKGC7P&pd_rd_r=41a17b7b-8222-4312-a986-6a1eaabcf8d4&pd_rd_wg=c68Hx&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) | This is another must-have on your software engineering bookshelf! Git is the most widely used version control system these days. Any serious IT organization uses it and will expect you to work with it starting from Day 1. Thus, it is only in your best interest to learn it. This book not only discusses Git and its core functions, but also talks about SourceTree, the intuitive user interface developed by Atlassian to ease into version control and make it user-friendly. I highly recommend this book if you find yourself struggling with Git. I have read three other highly recommended books on Amazon and took away absolutely nothing from them. This book is quite the opposite! Get it and you'll finish reading it in no time. |
