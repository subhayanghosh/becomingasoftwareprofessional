# Becoming A Software Professional // Work in Progress
Congratulations! If you've made it this far you can pat yourself on the back. Mastering the fundamentals in a career like software engineering is no small feat. Great work indeed! But as you might have guessed studying doesn't end here. 


## Resources :point_down:
Please go through these resources in the listed order. Bookmark them if you must. It is time to do the actual work starting today!
| Book / Course / Platform | Review |
| --- | ----------- |
| [SQL QuickStart Guide](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B081P1YYFB/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=1T9iR&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=J2KY0XENGFQCDRSNTC8K&pd_rd_r=1aaafd3d-e98f-4713-8517-fa692f501a56&pd_rd_wg=128ET&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) | I absolutely loved this book! Working on toy datasets at university will only take you so far. Dealing with real-world data comes with a lot more complexity and only a deeper understanding of it can lead to true business value. Thus, you must pick up a database programming language that lets you extract and retrieve relevant information. None of it is unfortunately taught in lectures, but this book helps to fill the void for a structured introduction to the declarative language (specifies *what* to do rather than *how* to do it) named SQL, short for Structured Query Language. I have come across many high-rated tutorials but their content is not sufficient. This book gives you a necessary overview of all the tools and techniques you will require in your very first year as a software engineer. It contains a database software and sample data to familiarize yourself with how a database is set up and how it is to be used. Moreover, many examples and exercises will guide you through and help you absorb new concepts quickly. |
| [Learning Source Control with Git and SourceTree](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B074HFY8HW/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=MrDUV&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=N1PR5B7RAGFT3TDKGC7P&pd_rd_r=41a17b7b-8222-4312-a986-6a1eaabcf8d4&pd_rd_wg=c68Hx&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) | This is another must-have on your software engineering bookshelf! Git is the most widely used version control system these days that allows you to journal your progress and collaborate with others. Any serious IT organization uses it and will expect you to work with it from Day 1. Thus, it is only in your best interest to learn it. This book not only discusses Git and its core functions, but also talks about SourceTree, the intuitive user interface developed by Atlassian to ease into version control and make it user-friendly. I highly recommend this book if you find yourself struggling with Git. I have read three other highly recommended books on Amazon and took away absolutely nothing from them. This book is quite the opposite! Get it and you'll finish reading it in no time. |
| [Introducing Maven](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B07ZX5SKYH/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3TZ0QLJ2IYGE9&keywords=maven&qid=1640714489&s=books&sprefix=maven%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C299&sr=1-2) | Like other craftsmen, software developers rely on their tools to build applications. Integrated development environments (IDEs), bug-tracking tools, build tools, frameworks, containers, and debug tools play a vital role in day-to-day development and maintenance of quality software. Apache Maven is an open source, standards-based project management framework that greatly simplifies the compiling, running, packaging, testing and reporting of projects. It is the de facto standard for Java and JEE-based projects in enterprises throughout the world. This book walks you through the setup of Maven on your local computer. It also takes a deeper look into Maven dependency management, the organization of a basic Maven project, Mavenâ€™s lifecycle, plug-ins, build phases, goals, archetypes, and how to leverage them effectively. |
| [Ant](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B074HFY8HW/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=MrDUV&pf_rd_p=6e9da02f-f7a3-444f-aea6-9ef09ed8bb89&pf_rd_r=N1PR5B7RAGFT3TDKGC7P&pd_rd_r=41a17b7b-8222-4312-a986-6a1eaabcf8d4&pd_rd_wg=c68Hx&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) | Ant is a declarative scripted build tool. Ant is Java-based and it uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) for its configuration. Using Ant typically involves defining tasks and targets (i.e. a set of tasks), such as creating a directory, running a test, compiling source code, building a web application archive (WAR) file, and so forth. In Ant we have to configure everything explicity. That makes for a shorter learning curve. |
